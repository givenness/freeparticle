title: About
---

I am an operator and artist tangled across music and tech.

I am currently working on the following teams... 

* [Friends with Benefits](https://fwb.help/) operations & events 
* [Refraction](https://www.refractionfestival.com/) curation & grants
* [Seed Club](https://www.seedclub.xyz/) Accelerator 

Previously, I co-owned a modular synthesizer company, served as the Director of Operations for a 501(c)(4) non-profit, and performed as [stud1nt](https://stud1nt.nyc/).
